Project-Skin-Care-Companion
mini project that done in MCA PROBLEM STATEMENT: Skin disease prediction faces several challenges, including limited high-quality datasets, diverse and complex disease appearances, and a scarcity of dermatological expertise. Human diagnosis can be subjective and prone to errors, while manual diagnosis is time-consuming and often inaccessible in rural areas. Additionally, specialized care can be expensive, and social stigma surrounding skin diseases can lead to delayed diagnosis.

SOLUTION APPROACH: This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for the prediction of skin diseases in humans and the provision of first aid recommendations. In this project Utilizing medical imaging and clinical data, the system employs advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately detect skin infections. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset encompassing various skin diseases and their manifestations in different demographic groups Upon identifying an infection. The main advantage of the system is to provides immediate first aid advice, including suitable antifungal treatments, wound care procedures, and recommendations for further medical consultation.

TECHNOLOGY STACK: Front-End: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface.
Back-End: Django for handling server-side logic and integrating the machine learning model. Database: SQL for storing structured data.
Machine Learning: TensorFlow for developing and training the machine learning model, and TensorFlow Serving for deploying the model to production.
